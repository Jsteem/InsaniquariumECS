# InsaniquariumECS




The introduction of the Entity Component System (ECS) significantly enhances the code's flexibility and manageability.

With ECS, integrating new features like pets and aliens is seamless and does not lead to complex, intertwined code. In the demo, you can observe various entities, each with distinct behaviors. For instance:

- Snail Pet: This entity specializes in collecting currency items, but it avoids food items.

- Seahorse Pet: This entity is responsible for dropping food.

- Fishbone Pet: This entity spawns gold coins.

- Oyster Pet: This entity spawns pearls.

- Alien: The alien entity attempts to consume fish but can be defeated by the player clicking on it. Fewer clicks are needed when upgrading the weapons.
